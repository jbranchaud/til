# Focus The URL Bar

There are a lot of things you can do in the browser without having to reach
for the mouse. Bringing the URL bar into focus is one of those things.

Hit `Cmd+L` in any modern browser (I've tried Chrome, Firefox, and Safari)
and the URL bar will be brought into focus. From there, you can quickly
change the URL of the current tab and your fingers never left the keyboard.
