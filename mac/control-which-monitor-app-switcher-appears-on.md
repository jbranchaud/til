# Control Which Monitor App Switcher Appears On

For the most part when I hit `cmd+tab` (and `cmd+shift+tab`) to switch between
apps, the visual switcher UI (which shows a row of the open apps) appears on my
main monitor. However, sometimes I will be hitting `cmd+tab` and nothing shows
up on my main monitor. I look to the right at my side monitor and there is the
app switcher UI.

Why is it appearing over there all of a sudden?

The reason is that the app switcher UI is anchored to the same screen where the
doc is located. Though the doc defaults to my main monitor, if I access the doc
from the side monitor, now it is anchored there.

To switch it back, I just have to make the doc slide up on my main monitor by
running my mouse down to the bottom of that screen.

The switch up was because I accidentally accessed the doc on my side monitor
without realizing.
