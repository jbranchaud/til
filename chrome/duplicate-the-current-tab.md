# Duplicate The Current Tab

Sometimes when viewing a page, you realize you want to keep that page open
but also go back to the previous page to view something else. An easy way of
achieving this is to duplicate the current tab and then go back.

To duplicate the current tab hit `Cmd+Enter` while the focus is on the URL
bar.

If the URL bar is not in focus, then first hit `Cmd+L` to focus followed by
`Cmd+Enter`.
