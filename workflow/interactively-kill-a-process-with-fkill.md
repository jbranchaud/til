# Interactively Kill A Process With fkill

The cross-platform [`fkill`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fkill-cli) tool
is a modern, friendly CLI for fabulously killing processes. It provides an
interactive interface for searching for the name or pid of a process that
needs killing.

Install it with yarn (or npm):

```bash
$ yarn global add fkill-cli
```

Then run it with no arguments to trigger the interactive mode.
