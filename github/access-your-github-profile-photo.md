# Access Your GitHub Profile Photo

Let's say I have my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jbranchaud) pulled up in
the browser.

```
https://github.com/jbranchaud
```

If I then add `.png` to the end of that in the URL bar:

```
https://github.com/jbranchaud.png
```

I'll be redirected to the URL where the full image file lives. In my case:

```
https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/694063?v=4
```

You can pull up yours `https://github.com/<username>.png` to access your profile
image.
